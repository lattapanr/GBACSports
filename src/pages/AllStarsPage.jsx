          <h2>Pupils wanting to buy a GBAC All-Star jersey.</h2>
          <p>
            Most pupils who have previously participated in an All-Star Match have already purchased the jerseys they wore on the day as a memento, and all nominated pupils can do so for à¸¿1,590. Pupils who buy their jersey will also receive a GBAC representation certificate of achievement to acknowledge their efforts and an official GBAC letter of recognition confirming their participation in the prestigious event. Both certificate and letter could be used to support university applications, and all funds raised will go towards maintaining the GBAC All-Stars for future academic years.
